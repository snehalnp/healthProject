Health Tracking for Elders

There are multiple things that are beneficial to live a healthier and better life for 65+ years old. I have tries implementing some (tracking repvious health records, exercise and activity tracking, nutritional and meal planning) of the below mentioned using Django and SQL. 

1) Tracking Previous Health Records: 
   This enables the users to track their health parameters, such as daily steps, heart rate, sleep patterns and blood pressure.
2) Exercise and Activity Tracking:
   This feature allows users to log their physical activities, such as walking, jogging, or yoga sessions. In future, we can also add on feature to provide recommendations and customize the workout or yoga asanas. This can also include progress tracking features to motivate the users.
3) Nutritional and Meal Planning:
   The feature provides users to track their daily food intake and calorie tracker. In future, this feature can also add with nutritional recipe suggestions. 
4) Medication Management: 
   It allows users to track their medications. Implementing notifications for missed or upcoming pills. Also, provide an option for users to input and store their medical prescriptions wherein the doctors can update the medicines if required and users can access them easily.
5) Happy Club:
   Here the mission will be to make senior citizens productive and engage in their second innings of their lives. This feature will list all the programmes arranged for senior citizens in their near by areas, where they will be learning new things, signing, dancing, art and craft, mental health and many more to help them find the joy and happiness in this modern and technological era.
6) Fall prevention and safety: 
   Advise them to take precautions to prevent falls, such as using grab bars or handrails, and wearing appropriate footwear. Suggesting them having regular eye check-ups to ensure good vision, as poor eyesight can contribute to falls.
